Today, I gave a short talk about my recent research on head direction signals in human navigation at the UCI [Associated Graduate Students (AGS) Virtual Symposium]( https://www.ags.uci.edu/cfp-2021-ags-virtual-symposium/). The questions I received gave me some clues on the knowledge gap between scientists who use fMRI and other biologists about my particular research. And Iâ€™d thus better polish my future talks to fill the gap. In addition, I'm glad to receive the Audience Choice Award, which is an acknowledgment for my research and presentation.
