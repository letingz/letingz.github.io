Today, I presented my work on head direction signals in the human brain at this year's [annual meeting of the organization for human brain mapping (OHBM)](2021). The conference focuses on understanding the organization of the human brain using neuroimaging methods. At this conference, I learned about new fMRI data analyses methods and different perspectives on open science and publishing.
