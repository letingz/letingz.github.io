This morning, I presented my recent research on head direction signals in the human brain to prospective [interdepartmental neuroscience program (INP)](https://inp.uci.edu/) PhD students. It was a 5min short presentation with 3min Q&A. I received many interesting and diverse questions from prospective students and also learned about my colleagues' cool research through their presentations. I hope many young and energetic 'brains' will join the UCI neuroscience community in the coming year!
