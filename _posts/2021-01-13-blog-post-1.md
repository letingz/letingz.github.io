I am glad to annouce the publication of my new coursera guided project ["Visualizing Static Networks with R"](https://www.coursera.org/projects/visualizing-static-networks-r). This project teaches learners how to visualize different types of static networks, which can be easily used in reports and presentations. The course can be considered as an intro course to network analyses and network visualization.
