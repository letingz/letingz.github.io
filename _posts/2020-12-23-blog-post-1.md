I'm glad to receive this year's [Trainee Professional Development Award (TPDA)](https://www.sfn.org/meetings/meeting-awards/trainee-professional-development-award) from Society for Neuroscience (Sfn). With this award, I receive complimentary registration to attend the [upcoming Sfn Global Connectome virtual event](https://www.sfn.org/meetings/virtual-events/sfn-global-connectome-a-virtual-event/). More importantly, I will also receive access to professional development opportunities on [Neuronline](https://neuronline.sfn.org/) in the following year and get to network with other receipients who conduct cool neuroscience research!

I'd like to end this short post with one of my favorite sayings from the Nobel Laureate Dr. May-Britt Moser:"A good designer has a lot in common with a good researcher. Both hunt for excellence and perfection. And you have to really focus on the details, and you donâ€™t really know what the final result will be before you have it."
