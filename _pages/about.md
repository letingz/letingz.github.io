**My Dissertation:**

- Title: *Three Essays on The Economics of Information Security*
- Motivation: 
  - In recent years, information security has been gaining increasing public attention and has
    become a high priority for organizations across various industries. However, cyber-risks continue
    to escalate as digital transformations are growing rapidly, and new areas of cyber-vulnerability are
    exposed and exploited. Thus, a critical question for managers, stakeholders, and policymakers
    is: How to strategically ensure the security of digital assets? Guided by the core question, my
    dissertation explores and advances three critical themes in the economics of the information
    security field.

- Optimal investment:
